# [Best Open Source Tools For Developers](https://dev.to/sarthology/best-open-source-tools-for-developers--300f)

Are you as excited as I am? In my quest to find some of the best apps for you, I myself discovered some absolutely brilliant tools. The best thing is all the apps below are free and Open Source. Let's get started 🏃🏻‍♂️

### 1. Screencat 🙀

This next app makes screen sharing super easy. You can share your desktop with someone else while letting them share your mouse and keyboard remotely. It's built in electron.js.

### 2. Manta 💸

The most frustrating part of any freelance gig is sending an invoice to the client. Searching a template online and then editing it in a word processor takes a lot of time and the result still looks ugly. Try Manta, a desktop application for creating invoices with beautiful and customizable templates. It will make the work hassle-free for you.

### 3. Brave Browser

Privacy and security should be everyone's top priority, and that's what I always talk about on[my blog](https://medium.com/@Sarthaksharma0)also. A browser is the first thing on the list when it comes to changing apps for the sake of privacy. Google tracks a lot of your data from Google Chrome, even if you are using a VPN. Use Brave, it's free and Open Source. Check some other cool apps for online privacy[here](https://medium.com/naturehub/the-only-apps-you-need-to-ensure-online-privacy-344d36afc45f)

### 4. Mark text 📝

Markdown is awesome and so are the markdown editors. There are many open source Markdown editors but Mark Text is the coolest I know. It has live preview which is one of my favorite features. Give it a try.

### 5. IconGenerator 👾
