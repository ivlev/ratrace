Family offices have evolved from the mega-money-centric, often hidebound institutions of a bygone era \(by which we mean a few decades ago\).[Today the services offered by an energetic family office more closely resemble those of a life coach/creative director/spin-doctor, than a financial advisor.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ffrancoisbotha%2F2018%2F08%2F20%2F12-tools-to-run-your-family-office-like-a-silicon-valley-startup%2F&text=Today%20the%20services%20offered%20by%20a%20family%20office%20more%20closely%20resemble%20those%20of%20a%20life%20coach%20than%20a%20financial%20advisor.) Tasks, like positioning the family business within a specific area, managing potentially negative 'press' or guiding the business to the “next big thing”, are all within the scope of the new family office.

Ponderous is definitely out—family offices today need to be light, agile and able to pivot. But it's a big universe out there: Where and how to begin? Check out the following short list of resources that can help turn your family office from a dinosaur into a veritable Silicon Valley startup.
