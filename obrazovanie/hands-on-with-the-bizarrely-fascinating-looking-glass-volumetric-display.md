What good is 3D? Does depth give you anything worthwhile in an interface that’s most likely flat anyway? Is “immersion” as a metric really worth that much?

Even as a ton of startups and big companies have invested in 3D-centric hardware and software, there has undoubtedly been some pushback on whether it’s all that necessary. I grappled with some of these questions when I played with the latest project from[Looking Glass Factory](https://lookingglassfactory.com/), a desktop volumetric display that they see as so central to the company’s goals that they’ve just named it the Looking Glass.

My experience with it left me a bit perplexed with where the tech would end up, but god dammit was it cool anyway.

The startup is in the midst of a[crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lookingglass/the-looking-glass-a-holographic-display-for-3d-cre)to gauge interest in such a product, they’ve raised about $775k with north of 1,200 backers. I had a chance to try out both of the versions of what they’re shipping, a $450 8.9 inch version and a $2,500 15.6 inch type.

The display is beaming 45 views of an object, each at 60 frames per second delivering images that you can peer around and see multiple angles of. How it works is that the display is basically sending out a fan of perspectives which can be observed by multiple people from multiple perspectives. No matter what you initially hear about the technical details of how it all works, there is a certain degree of disbelief baked into seeing a volumetric display like this for the first time. It’s like… looking into a fishbowl of pixels.

Looking Glass Factory has been around since 2015 and has already shipped quite a few products that broadly fit into the world of holograms, this one comes at a time where it has the chance to be a little bit more than a toy for designers and creative types. Rather than putting on a headset, the company argues, this product offers these people the chance to easily see what they’re working on and show it to other without tossing a headset around.
